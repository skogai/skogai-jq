Convert value to boolean

Following the established pattern in config/jq-transforms/:

- Create to-boolean/schema.json (input/args/output schemas)
- Create to-boolean/test-input.json and test-expected.json
- Add test cases to test.sh
- Follow crud-get/crud-set structure exactly

## Success Criteria

- [ ] to-boolean/transform.jq created with proper jq logic
- [ ] to-boolean/schema.json created with input/args/output schemas
- [ ] to-boolean/test-input.json and test-expected.json created
- [ ] Test cases added to test.sh
- [ ] All tests pass (./test.sh exits 0)
- [ ] Pattern matches existing transformations (crud-get/crud-set)
